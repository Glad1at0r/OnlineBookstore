Frustration-Free Packaging
Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging is a multi-year initiative designed to make it easier for customers to liberate products from their packages. Frustration-Free Packaging is easy-to-open, 100% recyclable and products ship in their own packages without additional shipping boxes -- it eliminates hard plastic "clamshell" cases and those annoying plastic-coated wire ties commonly used in toy packaging.  </p>
